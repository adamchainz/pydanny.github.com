&lt;p&gt;The launch of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5&lt;/a&gt; book has gone pretty well. The response has been almost entirely positive and sales have been pretty brisk. We've gotten a ton of great, constructive editorial feedback, which we're sorting through as we race towards the BETA release. Here are answers to the commonly asked questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-can-i-buy-the-book-via-paypal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I buy the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; via PayPal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will support PayPal in either the BETA or FINAL release of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to handle PayPal we need to find a reputable e-publisher that supports it that gives us similar rates, customer service, and product control (updates at any time, uploads of PDF, no surprise charges, etc) as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gumroad.com"&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt;. If you know of an e-publisher who is willing to provide that same level of service, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, we aren't leaving &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gumroad.com"&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt;. We just want to support developers and students who don't have credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; While we could certainly write our own publishing platform, that would delay work on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-can-i-get-a-kindle-mobi-or-epub-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I get a Kindle (mobi) or ePub version?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan is to support those formats in either the BETA or FINAL releases. In fact, I really love my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HCCNJU/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=cn-001-20"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;. I can't wait to proof my own &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on my favorite reading device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-can-i-get-a-print-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I get a print version?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to have a print version in about 30 days. We need to ensure that the cover and layout actually looks nice, and that involves ordering copies from the Lulu, CreateSpace, whatever and reviewing them and making corrections. Then ordering again to make sure the corrections look okay. That simply takes a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hoping for a mid-February release. Also, keep in mind we aren't sure yet if we'll do a print version of anything but a FINAL release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-are-the-beta-and-final-releases"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When are the BETA and FINAL releases?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't make promises, but at the latest, the FINAL &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be done by the start of March so people have them in hand at PyCon US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="is-this-book-going-to-get-updated"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this book going to get updated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we've already sent out three minor updates for grammar and spelling issues, and some bug fixes.  Even after the FINAL version comes out, we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of self-published books is we have control of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-much-work-went-into-the-book"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much work went into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey&lt;/a&gt; and I put in hundreds of hours writing and testing the content. We worked 12-16 hour days for weeks. It was madness, but a glorious madness. We became like hermits and toiled on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; while ignoring distractions like sleep, food and consistent exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our amazing technical reviewers also worked very hard to provide us with critical commentary, advice and corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-should-i-send-errata"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where should I send errata?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send errata to &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com"&gt;2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="are-you-going-to-pycon-us"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you going to PyCon US?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Wouldn't miss &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/"&gt;PyCon US&lt;/a&gt; for the world! &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey&lt;/a&gt; and I met and fell in love at PyCon US 2010! We'll be there for at least the second day of  tutorials, all the talks, and all the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/"&gt;sprints&lt;/a&gt;. I've even got a blog post coming that should serve as a guide for beginning Python and Django developers attending the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shameless Plug:&lt;/em&gt; We're both speaking and giving a tutorial. Sign up for the tutorial or attend our talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wiring-up-django-packages-tutorial"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/"&gt;Wiring Up Django Packages&lt;/a&gt; (Tutorial)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just finished the Django tutorial. What do you do now? You wire in Django Packages! Django is part of an ecosphere of over 20,000 packages, which can be leveraged to great effect. This tutorial will teach the evaluation, use, and extension of third party Python and Django applications in your projects. This tutorial will be a lecture with a lot of detailed and annotated code examples. Instructors are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Greenfeld, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://brack3t.com/"&gt;Kenneth Love&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/"&gt;Getting Started with Django&lt;/a&gt; fame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="advanced-django-forms-usage-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/101/"&gt;Advanced Django Forms Usage&lt;/a&gt;  (Talk)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django forms are really powerful but there are edge cases, especially with class based views), that can cause a bit of anguish. This talk will go over how to handle many common solutions not currently described in the core documentation. It will also cover useful third-party libraries. Speaker is Daniel Greenfeld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-python-to-generate-art-and-sound-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/58/"&gt;Using Python To Generate Art And Sound&lt;/a&gt; (Talk)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to navigating the overwhelming Python audio/imaging landscape is understanding how the fundamentals work, using common data processing/visualization libraries, in-depth code samples, and simple math operations. I use the stdlib, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PIL, and PyCairo to create building blocks, which I then combine to demonstrate advanced sound and image generation techniques. Speaker is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="are-you-going-to-django-circus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you going to Django Circus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope so. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2013.djangocon.eu/"&gt;Django Circus&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. DjangoCon Europe, is one of the important industry events for us and we're trying to figure out logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our problem is that 2012 was a very hard year - the majority of our clients have not paid for the work that we did. Collecting is turning out to be extremely difficult, time consuming, and unpleasant. This is impacting everything we want to do in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-does-the-alpha-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does the ALPHA work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ALPHA is a preview version that we are selling at an introductory price of $12. When you purchase the ALPHA, you get access to the BETA and FINAL versions when they are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're wondering, we are planning to increase the price of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; when we release the BETA and FINAL versions.&lt;/p&gt;

We need more talk and tutorial submissions. Talks are 30 or 45 minute efforts in front of the PyCon audience and are recorded for posterity. Tutorials are three hours long and are given to attendees who have paid an additional fee in order to slurp in knowledge from the masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 3 hour tutorial side of things, &lt;strong&gt;we especially need more Intro to Python level submission&lt;/strong&gt;. That means getting beginners up to speed on basic Python techniques, so they can then exploit the other tutorials, conference, and sprints to their full advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="now-onto-some-questions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now onto some questions...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-would-like-to-give-a-tutorial-but-it-s-so-much-work-to-put-together-3-hours-of-quality-content"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. I would like to give a tutorial but it's so much work to put together 3 hours of quality content.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers of PyCon recognize that putting together a quality tutorial is an amazing amount of work. Which is why tutorial presenters are compensated for their effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-the-most-likely-length-talk-to-be-accepted-30-minutes-or-45-minutes"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. What is the most likely length talk to be accepted? 30 minutes or 45 minutes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of PyCon sessions are 30 minutes long, so 45 minute slots are rare and valuable commodities. So if your talk needs to be 45 minutes long your  proposal has to really speak to the PyCon talk reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, if reviewers send you information requests for any duration talk or tutorial, &lt;strong&gt;you dramatically increase your odds of talk acceptance with timely responses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as said before, PyCon really needs more &lt;strong&gt;introductory level Python tutorial&lt;/strong&gt; submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-would-like-to-present-a-talk-or-tutorial-but-i-can-t-afford-to-come-to-pycon"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. I would like to present a talk or tutorial but I can't afford to come to PyCon.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;amp;formkey=dGt4Z0dsY052VERJem4xUUFVQW9uQVE6MQ"&gt;financial aid program&lt;/a&gt; is said to favor accepted speakers to PyCon. They really want you to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-would-like-to-present-but-i-can-t-come-up-with-a-good-idea"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. I would like to present but I can't come up with a good idea!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this problem as well! Then I looked at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/tutorials/suggested_topics_2012/"&gt;Suggested Tutorial Topics&lt;/a&gt; and got some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ack-i-ve-got-a-talk-idea-but-it-s-going-to-take-me-too-much-time-to-put-it-together"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Ack! I've got a talk idea but it's going to take me too much time to put it together!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submit the talk anyway before the talk and in fields you aren't ready to fill in, simply put '&lt;strong&gt;TBD&lt;/strong&gt;'. Then over the course of the next few days replace TBD with real material. Don't wait too long though to fix those TBDs, no more than a week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-m-a-beginner-nobody-in-the-community-is-there-any-chance-my-proposal-will-get-accepted"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. I'm a beginner/nobody in the community, is there any chance my proposal will get accepted?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyCon talk/tutorial reviewers love to see new people present. While experienced/proven speakers have an edge, good talk/tutorial proposals from promising candidates &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; make it into the conference. Carefully double-check your submission, be responsive to reviewers, and stay positive. I'm not saying you will get in, but I am saying it's worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="good-luck"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good luck!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon 2013 is going to be bigger and better than any previous year. That's because we pull together as a community to run an amazing event that is known to jumpstart careers and cause amazing life changes. We can't do this without you, so hurry up on your &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp/"&gt;PyCon US 2013 submissions&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Here is my meme submission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-obfuscation-contest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Python Obfuscation Contest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;certain-to-be-controversial talk idea&lt;/strong&gt; would be where the speaker would solicit Pythonistas to submit a single arcane &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; code module that would have to display the text of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; There would be a '&lt;em&gt;Expert&lt;/em&gt;' category which would forbid the eval/exec functions. The &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Anything Goes Category&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; would allow use of &lt;strong&gt;eval/exec&lt;/strong&gt;. The conference talk would be where the speaker announces the winners and comments on the brilliant insanity of submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-in-space"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Python in Space!!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to hear any talk on how Python is used in space exploration or research. That includes NASA, SpaceX, ESA staffers or citizen scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="template-language-shootout"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Template Language Shootout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a benchmark heavy talk on the raw speed of various Python template systems, complete with hard numbers and pretty charts. This isn't just a matter of speed, but also a measure of terseness and total usage. The test code will need to be made public so it can be vetted, debated, and expanded upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-3-from-scratch"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Python 3 from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see a talk that shows how by using Python 3 from the start, you content that you got a edge over Python 2.x. This case study should be as technical as possible and shouldn't have anything do with migrating from 2.x to 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fun-and-games-with-numpy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Fun and games with NumPy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible library. It deserves a talk, specifically one where it is demonstrated to do something amazing. Maybe it's something scientific, maybe it's something crunching social data, maybe it's something I can't begin to imagine. Surprise and impress me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go, my submission of 5 talks to the &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013"&gt;PyCon 2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;talks/tutorials I'd like to see&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; meme. What do you want to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it's time for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-public-service-message-to-the-python-community"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Public Service Message to the Python Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. I'm here to talk to you about a very import subject: &lt;strong&gt;Submit your talk early to PyCon US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year there were hundreds of talks submitted for just a very few speaking slots. Unpaid volunteers labored for hours before and after their normal jobs reviewing and debating which talks were to get in. The volume of talks combined with simple reviewer fatigue means that earlier submitted talks get more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't leave your poor talk or tutorial out in the cold. Help us fix the problem in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp"&gt;Submit your talk as early as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don't normally take notes on lightning talks. I'm kicking myself now. &lt;strong&gt;Really hard.&lt;/strong&gt; I'll try and relate some of the talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import this and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/that"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;, a parody talk by Daniel Greenfeld (me). &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219244338029412352"&gt;Malcolm comment on it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting into space using weather balloons by Frank Pohlmann&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/audreyr/ponystrap"&gt;Ponystrap&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=31"&gt;video from DjangoCon Europe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog"&gt;Tagalog&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_languages"&gt;Philippine languages&lt;/a&gt; translation of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obligatory PyCon lighting talk on Vim by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/bry_bibat"&gt;Bryan Bibat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openerp.com/"&gt;OpenERP&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PliniusSecundus"&gt;Frank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.auberonsolutions.com/"&gt;Pohlmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-tan-pohlmann/4/a30/233"&gt;Ann Tan-Pohlmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A parody talk by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez"&gt;Sony Valdez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was on to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprints-and-tutorials"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprints and Tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraged at #pyconph seeing so many people declaring themselves beginners and then diving in. Enthusiasm was a bit contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219425413301157889"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary funding for the sprints came from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation"&gt;Django Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pythonsprints.com/"&gt;Python Sprints&lt;/a&gt;. That funding went towards food, drinks, and various logistics for handling the estimated 200+ attendee turnout.  Things sprinted on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django had it's own dedicated and very full room (no more chairs could fit so I sat on the floor), with Malcolm Tredinnick leading the effort, with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marconijr.com/"&gt;Marconi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr"&gt;Moreto&lt;/a&gt; helping out. It turned into mostly an effort to get a lot of people kick-started in Django. What was very heartening was watching people race through the tutorials on their own, and then work on projects using the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect next year the sprints will see a lot of submissions to Django core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to continue my work on Class Based View documentation, but it was wisely pointed out that I should focus more on helping others get moving in Django and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ansible"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ansible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://capsunlock.net"&gt;Rodney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cocoy"&gt;Quillo&lt;/a&gt; led the sprint on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ansible.github.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; tool of which he is so fond. About seven people fond of engineering joined him. They seemed very productive and happy by day's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pymongo"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pymongo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of developers working on embedded devices gathered to work out an edge case issue with pymongo. I wish I knew more about their efforts, but I can tell you that this sort of very serious engineering effort is very common amongst professional Filipino developers. Because of geography, telecommunications and embedded devices are much more prevalent in the island nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-efforts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other efforts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I'm kicking myself. There were a ton of other development going on and I didn't document any of it. Certainly I was busy here and there helping out, but this is the sort of thing you need to document at the moment. Next time I assure you I will be very diligent about recording the efforts of so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorial-room"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tutorial Room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half the people stayed in what I dubbed the tutorial room. This is where speakers took turns going over material we had brought to the conference. Attendees followed along, and the diligence and focus in the room was very impressive. The tutorials/talks included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro to Python using Turtle by Sony Valdez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to git and github by Bryan Bibat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/intro-to-python-11186202"&gt;21 Cool Things You Can Do With Python&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Greenfeld (me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food-and-drinks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food and drinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean to mention that the breakfast, lunch, and snacks at PyCon Philippines 2012 were pretty good. The logistic chairs had decided rather than gamble on the usual sort of over-priced and not-so-good professional catering service that most conferences rely on to the dismay of... well... everyone, to go with local restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner people went out on their own. We were lucky enough to go to Pino in Quezon City both times. The Kare-Kareng Bagnet was really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conference-end"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference chair, Frank Pohlmann, gave us a few well spoken words about how wonderful the event was to run and host. How gratifying it was to see the enthusiasm and dedication of the attendees, and how inspired he felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we cheered him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that it was a lot of pictures and goodbyes to many new friends. Which meant a lot of sad feelings about a great event coming to an end. I felt inspired and changed. I wasn't the same person going in as I was coming out. I'm more grateful for what I have, and deeply honored that I had this chance to bring PyCon to so many wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More thoughts on PyCon Philippines in a forthcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coming-soon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coming soon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Story of PyCon Philippines&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can assure you that PyCon PH was an wonderful, amazing, humbling experience. I'm hoping that this post and others will get across to you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="arrival"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Pohlmann, chairman of PyCon Philippines picked us up and drove us to the event. He had worked day and night getting the event ready, all the while running his company, working a job, and being a father to his lovely 21 month old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we arrived at the venue, Audrey and I were met by our good friend, Filipino-American Bryan Veloso of Github, who was to provide the closing keynote. As soon as Bryan heard that there was going to be a PyCon in the Philippines he gave up his trip to Europython to be a speaker at PyCon PH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, we were greeted Ann Tan-Pohlman, logistics co-chair and volunteer organizer. She had over a dozen volunteers getting ready for the oncoming flood of registrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the herculean efforts of the organizers and volunteers of this event in a forthcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inspiration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed a large group gather by a side corridor and went to say hello. There we met &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez"&gt;Sony Valdez&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.13hq.com/"&gt;Agoo Computer College&lt;/a&gt;, and forty of his faculty and students. They were buzzing with energy and excitement, belying the fact that they had left at midnight the night before in order to arrive on time (they traveled many hours by bus). Audrey, Bryan, and I were floored by their effort to educate themselves, and were determined in our speeches not to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the majority of the Agoo Computer Science had to go in the middle of the afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;We didn't know they had to go until it was time to leave&lt;/strong&gt;. Next year I plan to do whatever is possible to help them come for the duration of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-begins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon Begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the national anthem, the Dean of Computer Science, Adrian Roy Valdez, started the event with a few words. Frank Pohlmann, PyCon PH chair thanked everyone involved including the sponsors, speakers, and especially the attendees. I gave a keynote speech I'll blog about shortly, and then it was time for the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intro-to-python-1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intro to Python &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/titopao"&gt;Paolo Barazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulo gave the Intro to Python talk. He was burdened by some equipment issues, but kept going undeterred. It reminded me of the first time I spoke at PyCon 2010, when for the first 10 minutes of my talk they couldn't get the projector to work. In any case, Paolo did a great job under very trying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-tricks-you-can-t-live-without-2"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python Tricks you can't live without &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey summarized a lot of the really important things you need to know in Python but aren't part of an introductory talk. Things like pip and virtualenv, how to construct packages, basic use of PyPI, and hammered home the need for good documentation. I may be partial, but I think this was the best version of this kind of talk ever given. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="django-quickstart-3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Django Quickstart &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marconijr.com/"&gt;Marconi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr"&gt;Moreto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marconi built off what Audrey provided, and added to it by giving a good introduction to Django. He also contributed a lot during the sprints the next day by pitching in with beginners. His talk featured code for a simple TODO app, and you can see the working example at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://quickstart.marconijr.com/"&gt;http://quickstart.marconijr.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="game-programming-with-python-4"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game Programming with Python  &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you afraid of math? Too bad! In this tutorial you will learn how to math! Scary, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Sony Valdez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Valdez, who I mentioned earlier, gave a talk on pygame and math while wearing the Barong Talalog. Not just any talk on pygame, but the best one I've ever seen. He's a natural speaker and educator, and extremely funny. And while giving this amazing talk on no sleep (remember - he was on a bus with 40 of his students and faculty), he broke many classic presenter rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Live code demo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote a functioning game while giving this talk. He made his mistakes part of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Used notepad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. He didn't use Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, or PyCharm. He used notepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Someone else's laptop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used an unfamiliar computer for his talk. Ever try and type on a keyboard you aren't familiar with? This is what he was dealing with while after a 5+ hour bus journey with probably no sleep the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="functional-programming-in-python-5"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functional Programming in Python  &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony was a hard act to follow, but Malcolm gave an amazing rendition of his classic talk on functional programming. I've seen Malcolm give this talk before, but this instance was clearly the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ansible-6"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ansible &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://capsunlock.net"&gt;Rodney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cocoy"&gt;Quillo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a python conference without one talk about system engineering? Fortunately for us, Rodney gave a talk on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ansible.github.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;, a pretty new Python based deployment tool. What makes Ansible different is it's range of options, and simplicity of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-didn-t-know-it-s-python-python-advocacy-7"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I didn't know it's Python: Python Advocacy &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id7"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;PyCon: More fun in the Philippines&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Variant of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.itsmorefuninthephilippines.com/"&gt;Philippines Department of Tourism slogan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulo Barazon returned to talk about the big users of Python, how to promote it's use, and why it's so awesome for... well.. lots of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="maps-of-imaginary-lands-8"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maps of Imaginary Lands &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id8"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malcom came back to give us a talk on how to assemble the components necessary to do a mashup of an imaginary place he cooked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="closing-keynote-design-your-open-source-project-9"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Keynote: Design your open source project &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id9"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan closed out the day with an inspirational and funny keynote speech instructing beginners on how to make your project used and loved by developers. His slides were incredible, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/bryan/p/design-your-own-open-source-project"&gt;as you should see for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

PyCon is a volunteer run effort that brings together Python developers from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels into a friendly, cooperative environment in order to educate, inspire, and work together - building relationships that transcend the event and can turn into lifelong friendships or even very impressive business alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is possible due to the hard work and contributions of members of the Manila Python users group, the support of the Python Software Foundation, various members of the Python community, our gracious sponsors, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be there, along with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt; and Django core developer &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt;. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Python?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; is an open source programming language used for science, engineering, robotics, entertainment, web development, and more. It is used by organizations such as Google, NASA, Instagram, Pinterest, Mozilla, Walt Disney Animation Studios, WETA Digital, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interested-in-attending"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interested in attending?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then head to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ph.pycon.org/register.html"&gt;registration page&lt;/a&gt;. The early bird discount ends on June 15th, so buy your tickets now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interested-in-sponsoring"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interested in sponsoring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please go to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ph.pycon.org/sponsor.html"&gt;sponsorship page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sponsorship would go a long way towards making PyCon Philippines 2012 a memorable event. As this is an entirely volunteer-run event, 100% of funds go toward actual event costs: food, drinks, chairs, tables, signage, nametags, flyers, advertising, etc. Per custom with PyCons around the world, the organizers receive no payment for their efforts, and any funds left over will be either placed in a Philippine based non-profit corporation or donated back to the Python Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a Python powered product comparison site that combines the best features of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.org"&gt;Open Comparison&lt;/a&gt;, Yelp, Consumer Reports, and Pinterest. We've worked day and night to make it better, with countless members of the Python community using the site and giving us invaluable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that brings us to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/2012/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt;. We're not just here as attendees and participants, but also to promote our startup.  It used to be the cool thing to launch your startup at SXSW, but times have changed. Now it's the cool thing to launch at PyCon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Twilio, Twitter, Facebook, and Google, we've got an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://api.consumernotebook.com"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; we want developers to use. And as an upcoming startup, we've got to really be creative in how we gain your attention, so here is what we're doing for PyCon 2012:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="demos-at-our-pycon-startup-row-booth"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Demos at our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/"&gt;PyCon Startup Row&lt;/a&gt; booth.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks PyCon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a booth on Saturday. We've got banners and bright red track jackets. We're giving out handy API reference cards, as well as 10 different &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/lists/audreyr/list-of-oreo-cookie-flavors/"&gt;flavors of Oreo cookies&lt;/a&gt; (see our site for a complete list of every Oreo cookie flavor, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stop on by, sign up for the BETA, have a cookie, and talk to us about our API. For that matter, feel free to talk to me or Audrey about the API any time you see us. We're wearing bright red jackets with '&lt;strong&gt;Ask me about our API&lt;/strong&gt;' on our back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the API, the next item on our plan is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-big-kickoff-api-contest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. A big kickoff API contest.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've put together the Consumer Notebook &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://api.consumernotebook.com"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you get product list
and comparison data out of our site via a simple REST interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're kicking off our PyCon 2012 API launch with an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://developers.consumernotebook.com/contest.html"&gt;API contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have from now until April 22 to find new and exciting ways to use our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://api.consumernotebook.com"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;. If you win we'll give you a Kindle Fire or equivalent gift certificate valid in your nation of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. We're hosting the Saturday night &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/"&gt;PyCon Capoeira Open Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to see some awesome Capoeira moves? Want to learn some of the basics? Want to just have fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've hired professional Hollywood stuntman and Capoeira instructor to the stars, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://valleycapoeira.com/?page_id=7"&gt;Contra Mestre Xingu&lt;/a&gt;, to come up from Los Angeles to lead this event. In addition to appearing in movies, videos, and commercials, he's got first hand experience with snakes. In his own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capoeira saved my life. What? How? Well it was a sunny afternoon, I was shooting a film in the Hollywood hills off Coldwater Canyon at a house. I was running back to set from the bathroom and out of nowhere a rattlesnake jumped up from the ground and tried to bite me. I quickly jumped out of the way and did a fast negative &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capoeira_techniques#Rol.C3.AA"&gt;rolé&lt;/a&gt; away from the snake. Then I called the other people on set and we caught it. I really didn't think much of it afterwards until after the shoot. My friend told me the rattlesnake was a young one and I'm lucky I didn't get bitten.  When a younger rattler bites you, it usually unloads all of it's venom in you because it cannot control the amount it releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Contra Mestre Xingu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 30 people have signed up up for this event, including Python core developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
When: Saturday, 8pm - 10pm
What to bring: Camera!
What to bring if you are participating: Workout clothes, water bottle
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was terribly excited for her to get that invitation, and that excitement was compounded when they allowed me to present on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer`:"&gt;Confessions of Joe Developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel is a passion of mine, and it's only been since 2007 that I've gotten a chance to do much seeing of the world. Australia was always this distant goal of mine, but I never thought I would get the chance to go. Fortunately, my assumption was wrong and we landed on August 18th in Sydney, Australia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreyr.posterous.com/thank-you-pycon-au"&gt;wrote her own statement about the event&lt;/a&gt; right after we were done. She's good that way. Okay then, off to my own review. This is belated, but better late then never, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conference-rooms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sydney Masonic Center was the venue and it was a really curious building. They built it a while ago, then apparently grafted an office building onto the top of the temple. &lt;strong&gt;You have to see it to believe it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main temple room was room, interesting, and fun. The acoustics, to my limited ear, seemed quite good. The alternative rooms for some of the tracks were small presentation rooms, which did quite nicely except when the organizers chose popular talks for small rooms and things overflowed. Everyone was good natured about that and we all just worked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="speakers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm partial but I think the opening keynote by Audrey Roy about diversity was wonderful. Mary Gardinar also talk about open source projects trying to change the world that need our support. Raymond Hettiger seriously delivered the goods with another version of his amazing talk about what makes Python great. Whatever you do, go and see it as many times as possible because he changes it each and every time.  Richard Jones' presentation on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/zen_of_python.html"&gt;Zen of Python&lt;/a&gt; was very solid too, and I'll use this as an opportunity to promote my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/that"&gt;Anti-Zen of Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time for me to present on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer`:"&gt;Confessions of Joe Developer&lt;/a&gt;, I finished way too early; plus me and Audrey felt the talk was not technical enough. Even though the reception for my talk was very positive, based on that experience and observation we ramped up the technical content for DjangoCon US and I delivered a much stronger talk. I want to thank the Australian Python community for being a wonderful audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/index.html"&gt;rest of the talks I saw were all quite good&lt;/a&gt;, in fact the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/decorators.html"&gt;one on decorators&lt;/a&gt; was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Super&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conference-meals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference Meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night before the conference, Frends/mentors Russell Keith-Magee and Malcolm Tredennick took me to a sushi-train place and we gobbled down some very nice raw seafood. Call me silly, but sushi on moving plates just tastes better! Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between talks they served nice little sandwiches. The coffee bar had lovely Flat Whites and considering the quality of dairy in Australia I was very happy with the break food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first night of the conference they served an amazing, amazing meal. The lamb was like nothing I've tasted before - my best way of describing it was &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;so this is how lamb is supposed to taste&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. We also got served Pavlova, which Audrey really enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last evening of the conference we went out to a famous Sydney gastropub/brewery and got kangaroo and crocodile pizza. The kangaroo was outstanding, but the alligator wasn't my thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference we went with Graham Dumpleton to a wonderful Dim Sum place and I stuffed myself silly while Audrey quizzed Graham on WSGI. I was sleepy for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pounds gained? Many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Superb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="parties"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some lovely dinners and hang-outs. It was incredible putting faces to names and personalities. Everyone looked as I imagined, which meant they looked smashing. Events tended to be lower key, which can make for some wonderfully nice, cozy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accommodations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accommodations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no official conference hotel so we stayed at World Hotel - in easy walking distance of the conference center. It wasn't cheap, but I've learned from painful experience that when you travel to a conference, you want to spend your time at the conference, not going to-and-from a cheap hotel five miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff of the hotel were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately they were working around the limitations of their building. The rooms were really tiny and rather stuffy. Normally that isn't an issue since we spend a lot of our time outside the room, but in this case Audrey was polishing her talk and needed a quiet room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Average but not the fault of the conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprints"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked with Richard Jones about PyPI authentication issues, and he decided to go with OpenID. Personally, I would prefer OAUTH but I'll take whatever I can get. On the behalf of the community Mark Rees implemented OpenID on PyPI at the sprint so things like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.org"&gt;http://opencomparison.org&lt;/a&gt; can support the community better. One goal at PyCon 2012 is to get that working as another authentication system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise I closed bugs and worked lintification of the project. Audrey and a couple Australian PyLadies, Elena Williams and Jenny Nguyen, worked some core Django documentation tickets. We didn't get as much done as we hoped thanks to an outside distraction, but the organization of the sprints was top-notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, those crazy Australians taught us how to do a &lt;strong&gt;Tim Tam Slam&lt;/strong&gt;. It's rather scary and not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="overall-result"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was run professionally. The leadership was on the ball. The few issues that cropped up were taken care of, certainly better then what I would have done. Thank you everyone who put it together or just gave us a great time: Tim Ansell, Richard Jones, Nick Coghlan, Russell Keith McGee, Graham Dumpleton, Malcolm Tredennick and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia was amazing. The people were wonderful. I wish we had more time to go sightseeing and relax, but we were off all too quickly. I could write a book about the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined Result: Great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Ha! What the heck was I thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I've already got in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wednesday-march-7th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday, March 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and Audrey are driving up from Los Angeles. I've wanted to do this drive for a while, so this is very exciting. We'll arrive in the evening and hopefully tag up with friends old and new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thursday-march-8th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thursday, March 8th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm moderating the Code Reuse panel of the Python Web Summit. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=1c9a94&amp;amp;t=1c9a94.43"&gt;Have you submitted a question yet&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we'll be helping assemble bags for the conference. That's always a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friday-march-9th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friday, March 9th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon really begins! I'll be at the keynotes, and then the talks begin. These are some of the talks I'm really leaning towards watching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/64/"&gt;Introduction to Metaclasses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/399/"&gt;The Art of Subclassing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/249/"&gt;Data, Design, Meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/246/"&gt;Code Generation in Python: Dismantling Jinja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that all the talks look awesome. Missing some of these talks is going to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we're going to the New Relic/Loggly/Skull Candy party and hang out at the (in)famous TIP BOF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="saturday-march-10th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday, March 10th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com"&gt;Consumer Notebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html"&gt;Startup Row&lt;/a&gt; booth all day! Come and hang out with us and all the other bright, new companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I'm hosting the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/"&gt;PyCon Capoeira Open Space&lt;/a&gt;. We've got a seriously large room assigned for the event, and over twenty five people currently signed up to participate (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira"&gt;there's still room for signups&lt;/a&gt;). Even if you don't want to play a musical instrument or learn/play at Capoeira, come anyway to watch. Some of the players there have some seriously amazing skills - I can assure you've seen them in the movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Monday March 12 - Thursday, March 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprints! Nothing set in stone yet, but some ideas I've had include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch python.opencomparison.org for all of Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenComparison integration of PyPI OpenID, SourceForge OAUTH, and BitBucket OAUTH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved OpenComparison integration of the Launchpad API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Gitorious API for OpenComparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Text Based search for OpenComparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hack on Mongo related technologies such as django-mongonaut and some other planned projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We submitted it to PyCon StartUp row and found out this morning we've been accepted. &lt;strong&gt;Hooray!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html"&gt;PyCon StartUp Row winner's post&lt;/a&gt;, here is a little bit of what we're about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="highlights"&gt;
Have you tried researching products online recently? Search engines are gamed by scammy marketers. Product review sites overwhelm you with ads, have unreliable reviews, or dryly compare raw product specs. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com"&gt;Consumer Notebook&lt;/a&gt; is working to solve this problem. It is like Yelp for products, with product comparison grids inspired by the founders' open-source work on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://djangopackages.com"&gt;Django Packages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.org"&gt;Open Comparison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so you know, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt; in North America is the biggest gathering for the international Python community. The conference this year is in Santa Clara, California, and is sold-out at 1500+ attendees, but could have easily sold out several times that number. The talks, tutorials, and events are going to be incredible, and I'm delighted to be part of the PyCon experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to sharing the StartUp Row with friends like Transifex, Python Packages, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.weddinglovely.com/"&gt;Wedding Lovely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com"&gt;Consumer Notebook&lt;/a&gt; right now and also visit our PyCon booth on Saturday, March 10th and we'll show you what we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

I had been sitting next to my friend &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://djangrrl.com/"&gt;Barbara&lt;/a&gt; and we got up to go when I heard a feminine voice ask: &amp;quot;Are you &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/bshaurette"&gt;bshaurette&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot; I turned and it was like I got punched in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I met &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey&lt;/a&gt;. I remember every detail of how she looked at that moment. The clothes she was wearing, the part in her hair, that her eyes met mine, and that they didn't turn away. I was immediately captivating, but fortunately remembered to act like a gentleman. I tossed in a casual invitation to her to join us for lunch, which I pulled off even though my heart was pounding. Thankfully she accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has been pretty much awesome ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the day I met the love of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
