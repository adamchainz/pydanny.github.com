This year in June, the European edition of DjangoCon_ is going to be held in lovely Zurich_, Switzerland_. It is my great fortune and delight to announce that Audrey_ and I will be attending. Hooray!

Needless to say, we're extremely excited. My `trip to Europe in 2007`_ was an amazingly fun and educational experience, and I can't wait to share a similar experience with Audrey. We can't wait to see all our old European friends, make new ones, and be dazzled by what Europe has to offer.

Also, let's face it, the conference is going to be **incredible**. They've lined up some awesome venues, the food (cheese_, chocolate, muesli, etc) in Switzerland is world-renowned, the website looks fantastic, and they've got Jacob Kaplan-Moss to keynote. It looks so good I'm surprised there are any `sponsor slots left`_!

Talks
=====

While attending the conference, we submitted and hope to give a presentation on the positives (speed, flexibility, community, etc) and negatives (a few) of using MongoDB_ as a Django_ datastore. I'm also considering giving a second talk. Some ideas for that include:

* Zen of Django
* Django isn't for beginners (A Tredennick inspired talk explaining why teaching beginning developers Django isn't a good idea)
* Advanced Django Template Usage
* Advanced Django Models Usage (An intimidating talk to put together)
* Django Packages Thunderdome II

Any thoughts?

While I'm at it, I'm going to poke any prospective conference goers to submit their own talks. I love attending conference talks and at PyCon US this year I barely got to see any. Show me what you got!
