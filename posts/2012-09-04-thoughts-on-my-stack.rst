I'm an open source developer. I use Python, Django, PosgreSQL, JQuery, MongoDB, Memcached, and Redis. I push production code to Linux servers.

And yet:

* My laptop runs Apple's Mac OS X.
* My primary editor is Sublime Text.
* My production servers are provided mostly by Heroku.
* All my sites are hosted on Amazon EC2.

I've got nothing against Apple, Heroku, or Amazon, but their tools are not open source.

And that's food for thought.
