The PyCon_ tutorial on Django in Depth was ending. I had been sitting next to my friend Barbara_ and we got up to go when I heard a feminine voice ask: "Are you bshaurette_?" I turned and it was like I got punched in the gut.

It was the first time I met Audrey_. I remember every detail of how she looked at that moment. The clothes she was wearing, the part in her hair, that her eyes met mine, and that they didn't turn away. I was immediately captivating, but fortunately remembered to act like a gentleman. I tossed in a casual invitation to her to join us for lunch, which I pulled off even though my heart was pounding. Thankfully she accepted.

Life has been pretty much awesome ever since.

That was the day I met the love of my life.
