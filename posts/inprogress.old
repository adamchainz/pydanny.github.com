This was my fifth PyCon and the first time in years I didn't submit a talk for a major Python event I was planning to attend. I was rather overwhelmed when talk submissions were due, was wiped out from a long list of good and bad things on my plate, and wasn't entirely certain I would be able to attend. I thought not having talks would keep me from being terribly busy at the conference, but once again I forgot how crazy-busy PyCon makes your life.

This PyCon was something like double the size of the previous PyCon. This gave the event a very different feel, more overwhelming and exciting than the previous year. The number of new faces was unbelievable, and I hope everyone had a great time. 

I want to state right now that I think the community feel of this year's PyCon felt the same as it did previous years. I was admittedly uncertain on Friday about this, but then I realized that even with the giant leap in size, everyone was the same. I think that's because at the heart of things, Python is a community as much as a language.

Alright, the review:

Conference Rooms
=================

Thanks to Github's generous donation and the agreement of the PyCon Chair, Consumer Notebook had a booth on both Friday and Saturday. This was an incredible opportunity that really helped us get more API traction. Which meant I only saw keynotes and a few talks on Sunday.

Therefore, I feel kind of awkward rating the conference rooms. The rooms I did visit did have comfortable seats and lots of power strips. They were a bit chilly, but I wear sweaters when others wear shorts.

**Result: Great**

Speakers
=========

The keynotes were amazing. For someone co-running a startup, Paul Graham's talk was validating and frightening at the same time. 

For the same reason I didn't spend much time in the conference rooms, I really didn't get to see many of the speakers. I did see Jessica McKellar and Asheesh Loriaoa speak about their experiences growing Boston Python in both size and diversity. Their work is impressive and they deserve ongoing accolades for the volume of success they've generated.

In fact, I think their way of bringing people into community  via their pattern of offering both classes and hacker nights is the best. The former to provide a grounding and the latter to increase skills of beginners and grow the beginner's sense of community. From an academic perspective the hacker nights could be seen almost as a lab. Classes alone don't do it, you need to get people in there doing their own thing. 

The success Boston Python has enjoyed in the growth of numbers certainly validates my opinion. 

**Result: Great**

Accomodations
=============

We stayed at the Hilton across the street and it was really nice. The staff were wonderful and very helpful. The Hyatt and Conference center staff was also very nice and I can't say enough good things about them.

**Result: Superb**

Conference Meals
================

American conference food at best is adequate. That much could be said for the conference meals until Sunday lunch, when pretty much our entire table got up and went to the Hilton Bar. This isn't the fault of the conference, but rather the venue meal preparation staff.

**Result: Mediocre but not the fault of the conference**

PyCon Web Summit
=================

**Result: Great**

Sprints
=======

I'll be blogging about this separately. The gist of it is that something things went smashing
