On October 16th, 2011, which was one hundred and sixty-four days before today I resolved to get myself onto the Longest Streak list of `Calendar About Nothing`_. Today, with this blog post, I've managed to do just that - get on the Longest Streaks.

Calendar About Nothing tracks your open project commits on Github_. It tallies your total number of days, records your longest streak, and lets you compare yourself against other committers. The idea comes from an article_ where Jerry Seinfeld says his secret to productivity is to get something done every day, because if you skip one day then skipping another day is easier.

I feel a great sense of accomplishment.
=======================================

The majority of those days I would like to think I did real commits. I pledged to myself to do more than just white space tweaks or write a script to do the work for me. I wanted to accomplish things and make a difference. I started projects, wrote code, cleaned up old code, added tests, documented a lot, and moved my blog here. It's been an awesome time, and keeping my fingers constantly in projects has been eye opening.

I feel a great sense of relief.
===============================

I've really enjoyed this but there were days it was hard to get to the internet or days I was busy on other things. I discovered early on my phone was not a good interface with Github's text editor. Some days I had no desire to code or lacked the creativity to write. Then I remembered that my ability to work openly on Github is a gift, and I should just do it. Now I can relax a bit and if I miss a day, it's not such a big deal. I've made it to the Longest Streak list!

Going for a longer streak
=========================

We'll see what happens now. I just feel happy that I've captured the moment and made my mark on the board. I invite you to do the same.
