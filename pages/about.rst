I'm the principal of `Cartwheel Web`_, which does Python, Django, and JavaScript out of Los Angeles, California. I love to read, write, hang out with my fiancee_, and play at Capoeira_. I am a total Space and NASA Geek.

Book

I co-wrote a book_:

   :name: Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5
   :align: center
   :target: http://django.2scoops.org/



Django, like any framework, has tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't documented in one place. Experienced developers know this stuff, but gleaning it off the Internet takes a lot of time. We decided to take everything we know and write it down. This book_ reflects a portion of what we documented, and if it does well we plan to follow it up with other references.
