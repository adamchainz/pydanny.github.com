Last month `Audrey Roy`_ and I launched a book_ about Django called `Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5`_. We sold it without using PayPal because we were worried about having our account frozen. That turned out to be a very wise move.

PayPal and Open Source Events
===============================

PayPal has a long, sordid history of freezing the accounts of Python related conferences and events around the world, in fact as I write this `DjangoCon Europe 2013 has it's PayPal account frozen`_. In the past, `DjangoCon Europe 2012`_, Plone Conferences 2008, 2011, and at least one PyCon Australia dealt with the same issue, with the combined total of locked accounts being well over US$100,000 dollars. It's not just a Python issue either, it's an issue that `strikes other open source languages and tools`_, and **most conferences keep quiet about it** because **they're afraid that raising a fuss will annoy PayPal's anti-fraud division**. 

Considering the fear and shame that dealing with PayPal's anti-fraud division instills, the occasions of conference accounts known to be frozen by PayPal are likely to be a fraction of actual events hurt by their policies.

The usual way conferences deal with these lockouts is they beg and borrow from friends, family, against mortgages, local banking institutions, and pray that PayPal will eventually free their account. When you deal with a hostile, inaccessible payment gateway who won't let you provide for the hundreds or even thousands of people who paid you their hard earned money, it's the only way to get by.

The Needs of PayPal's Anti-Fraud Division
=========================================


While we could respect the needs of PayPal's anti-fraud division when dealing with non-fungible products like ticket sales, it's **simply unacceptable** that prominent conferences for open source projects are treated this way. The software represented by these conferences drive the modern world, including the myriad of e-commerce systems that employ PayPal to process sales. Yet PayPal continues to burn open source conferences year after year, and we've never heard of any conference outreach by their so-called 'developer evangelists' when a conference's account is frozen.

For merchants of non-fungible goods such as mobile platforms and e-book authors like ourselves, PayPal is even more of a very treacherous option. We fully understand that with PayPal we could dramatically increase sales to regions of the world where credits cards are difficult to obtain. However, using PayPal places us at an unacceptable risk as we can't afford to deal with frozen accounts. Legal recourse against PayPal has always been extremely difficult, but as of last year PayPal's anti-class action lawsuit closed off another avenue of litigation.

It's Wrong to Use PayPal
=========================

Considering PayPal's unacceptable behavior in regards to the open source community we love, it's wrong doing any further business with them. In fact, after Pycon we're going to be exploring selling the book via Amazon, Google wallet, Payoneer, and other venues.

PayPal is at Risk
===================

There was a day when Microsoft had an unassailable lock on the commercial software world. They are a shadow of their former self, and I contend it wasn't just Apple's competition. Instead, their contempt for their own customers and the growing developer hurt them just as much.

PayPal is on the same path of self-destruction. Maybe not this year, or the next, but every time they damage their own customer base it's another nail in the coffin.

What Can We Do About PayPal?
============================

Besides refusing to use PayPal. PayPal has deep pockets, teams of aggressive lawyers, and isn't afraid to hurt us.
