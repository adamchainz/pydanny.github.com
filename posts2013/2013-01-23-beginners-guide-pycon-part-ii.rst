This is Part II in a series of blog posts about `PyCon US 2013`_. The goal is to provide a handy reference guide for first time attendees of the world's largest Python_ conference. `Part I`_ was mostly about tutorials_, today will be about registration and the first day of talks.

Registration
============

If you haven't done so yet, please register_ now. Last year PyCon sold out way in advance, and hundreds missed the event. Which is a shame, because the conference is awesome!

Keep in mind that the money you spend on registration will go towards a very good thing. You see, after the costs for running PyCon are subtracted, the rest will go to the non-profit Python Software Foundation (PSF_). In addition to supporting the Python language itself, the PSF provides financial aid and grants for aspiring developers around the world. Which means the money you spend registering for PyCon will literally change people's lives.

Alright, on to the first day of talks!

Talks
=====

At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and brightest in both old hands in the community and rising starts. Some quick guidelines:

* **Vote with your feet.** If you don't like a talk, at PyCon you are encouraged to get up and attend another talk.
* **Ask Questions!** If the speaker leaves time for it questions at the end, `go and ask`_! 
* **Don't heckle.** It's nerve wracking going up in front of hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video. Heckling is **never** funny and it's a good way to lose friends and make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the talk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.

Alright, that out of the way, let's take a look at what Friday has to offer us.

Friday Morning
---------------

The registration desk opens at 7:00 AM. Breakfast begins at 8:00 AM. From 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM is the welcome and initial keynote speeches. PyCon keynotes aren't boring - they are crazy fun. Say hi if you see me!

In selecting these talks, I've tried to focus on the more technical ones.

10:50 AM talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `How to Except When You're Excepting`_ (Esther Nam) - One of the rising stars of the community, Esther works for a group that demands 100% test coverage. She's going to cover the fundamentals of writing tests and why tests are a good thing.
* `How the Internet works`_ (Jessica McKellar) - Want to know how the internet actually works? Jessica McKellar (also giving two tutorials and a keynote speech) will use Python to help you understand what's really going on.
* `Gittip: Inspiring Generosity`_ (Chad Whitacre) - Gittip is an open source Python platform for sustaining open source development via small, anonymous donations. This is a technical case-study about the story of community.

11:30 AM talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Scrapy: it GETs the web`_ (Asheesh Laroia) - In 2009 I took a web scraping tutorial by the author. He impressed me with his energy and knowledge. While technically this is an **intermediate** talk, I know everyone will get something out of this talk

12:10 AM talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `API Design for Library Authors`_ (Chris McDonough) - Well designed APIs are critical for how other developers interact with your code. Chris is one of the talents in the community when it comes to creating easy-to-use but extremely powerful tools. I'm delighted he's made this an introductory talk.

Friday Lunch
------------

Quick notes:

1. Don't forget to keep your PyCon registration badge or they won't let you into the lunch room!
2. When you registered, you specified your meal preferences. Please stick to them. If you don't, you may cause people with dietary needs to go hungry.

* `Using Python To Generate Art And Sound`_ (Audrey Roy) - This is an **intermediate** talk, but myself and those who have seen it can assure you it's a very good talk. Audrey demonstrates how to use Python tools like NumPy, SciPy, and PIL to make lovely things.
* `You can be a speaker at PyCon!`_ (Anna Ravenscroft, Lynn Root) - PyCon loves new blood. Get some pointers on how to get your talks ready for submission next year!

2:35 PM talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This slot is going to be hard because all three beginner talks are things you don't want to miss!

* `Loop like a native: while, for, iterators, generators`_ (Ned Batchelder) - One of the really awesome features of Python is that you can write custom looping classes. Factor in generators and you'll be amazed by one of Python's most powerful features. 
* `Visualizing Github, Part I: Data to Information`_ (Dana Bauer, Idan Gazit) - How can you go wrong with visualizing GitHub data using Python?
* `Encapsulation with descriptors`_ (Luciano Ramalho) - Python has no private fields, but the property decorator lets you replace public attributes with getters and setters without breaking client code. It's amazing what Python can do when you delve into it's subtleties!
