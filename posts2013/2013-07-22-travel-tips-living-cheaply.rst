It's a given that in order to travel you need to have money or make a lot of money, right?

Actually, that's not really true. There are ways to live well but cheaply. It takes a bit of forethought and judgement, but the reward is amazing. This article explains how Audrey Roy and I do it.

Pick the Right Location
=======================

A number of famous destination cities are expensive no matter what you do. San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Berlin, and Tokyo might be wonderful, but they are also places where you have to pay. Rent, food, and accessory costs are likely to be at least double what you expect.

Similarly, certain entire countries are expensive. Switzerland, Slovenia, Australia, and New Zealand are lovely, but everything just costs more in those places.


Stay for a While
=================

Use a service like AirBnB or the local equivalent to find a place within walking distance of your favorite attractions.

* Some people use hostels and then find a local place
* Stay at least 30 days


Cook at Home
============

* Find the nearest big supermarket
* Don't try and replicate what you eat at home, cook simple things they make there
* Eat out once a week.
