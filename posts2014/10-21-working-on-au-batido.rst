I've been known for a while as this guy who likes to do one-handed cartwheels. That's nice, but I want to do more. Right now the thing I'm working on is called an **Aú Batido**. Translated from portuguese literally, it means 'broken cartwheel'. When done well, it looks like a cartwheel with a round kick.

I'm tracking my progress on `giveit100.com`_.

Part of why I'm doing this is because in just a few weeks I'll be at `Python Brasil`_, Brazil's big python conference. If you're going, see you there!
