1. My mother told me when I was little that if I didn't eat my oatmeal quickly, it wouldn't stop growing. I had visions of oatmeal rivers and oceans and ate quickly. To this day I still don't trust oatmeal.
2. When I was 19 my friends and I made a kung fu movie.
3. I don't like horror movies.
4. The first toy I remember loving was a gigantic (in my 5 year old hands) tonka cement mixer. 
5. I learned how to ride a bike when I was 6. I got a 3 speed when I was 8. I was 13 when I got a 10 speed.
6. I almost drowned once in a pool just from jumping in, even though I was an accomplished swimmer at the time.
7. I loathe macaroni and cheese.
8. I can remember every small detail of my maternal grandparent's house even though the family sold it over 20 years ago.
9. I had my right shoulder dislocated.
10. I've broken about 10 bones in my lifetime. Two were on the same finger and happened a day apart.
11. I've had about 7 or 8 concussions in my lifetime.
12. I wear bifocals.
13. I don't plan on ever dying. When do I get my immortality pill?
14. I love to travel and until a few years ago never got to do it. Now I try to make up for lost time.
15. I'm not much of one for static typing.
16. I find graph vizualization theory implementations a lot of fun.
17. Back in the 1980s I could beat all my friends playing the Apple ][+ game F-15 Strikefighter. They played it like an action game and I played it like a strategy game.
18. No one likes to play me in the board game called Clue. The way my brain works, I figure things out too fast. If only that worked when I played gambling card games I would be rich!
19. I was once evaluated as a non-linear thinker. Whatever that means.
20. I prefer Pericles over Socrates. The former was into democracy of the masses and the latter preferred the rule of the noble classes.
21. Since 19% of my taxes goes to the US military, I think I should get weekly flyovers at low speed of fighter jets.
22. First time I got drunk was with Peter Hewitt and Jon Clark at the age of 12 when we broke into Jon's parents liquor cabinet. My parents never found out, and to this day I have no idea how they could have missed it.
23. In my teens I dreamt I would die at a particular spot when I was 23. Rather than avoid that place I made sure I was there as much as possible.
24. In the spot detailed above, I found myself in petting distance of a deer one dark night.
25. When I was young I wanted to be an astronomer or astronaut. I worked NASA, not in those roles, but at least I supported them!
